## Side project for an Original GB Emulator (1989)

So far this has been an extremely fun project, seeing it slowly get pieced together. 

----

This is intended to be written entirely in C when possible. Using the C11/ GCC Compiler on Linux. Nothing being built is intended to run on windows.

##### Completing this project quickly is not my intention. It's to have fun, learn more, and get some sense of nostalgic working with old hardware emulation. 

------------
That being said. My goals are not set in stone. But at bare-min basic functionality would be nice.

### ðŸŽ® My priority so far:
 - [ ] Efficent, smart way of coding emulation
 - [ ] Proper Cartridge MBC, banking, ram, and time emulation
 - [ ] MMU address space handling.
 - [ ] CPU OP Code/ Instruction Emulation (Basic at first)
 - [ ] CPU, OP Code / PC syncronization. 
 - [ ] VRAM, GPU, LCD Emulation
 - [ ] Rendering of screen, logos, images, sprites.
 - [ ] Handling of multiple colour palette
 - [ ] PPU, APU emulation (Visual, LCD, Audio)
 - [ ] .. more I am sure


#### NOTE: This is VERY far from any functionality
    Base infastructure of the code is unfinished. Far from it.
    There is absolute zero gaurentee there will won't be breaking changes.
    There is a LOT left to do.
    There is no timeline, this is for fun.
