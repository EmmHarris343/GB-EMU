## Side project for an Original GB Emulator (1989)

So far this has been an extremely fun project, seeing it slowly get pieced together. 

----

This is intended to be written entirely in C when possible. Using the C11/ GCC Compiler on Linux. Nothing being built is intended to run on windows.

##### Completing this project quickly is not my intention. It's to have fun, learn more, and get some sense of nostalgic working with old hardware emulation. 


#### NOTE: This is VERY far from full functionality finished project, but that's kind of the point.
    There is absolute zero gaurentee there will won't be breaking changes.
    There is a LOT left to do.
    There is no timeline for completion, this is for fun.

------------

#### PROGRESS: I do want to note some progress so far (This is far from everything):
    ~95% of CPU instructions have been implemented
    ~50% of instructions tested. (LD, ADD, AND, OR, etc)
    4+ critical bugs involving Pointer-counter / de-sync issues have been fixed
    MBC Bank switching, implimented for 2-3 MBC Types.
    MMU and memory management put int place
    RAM, HRAM, WRAM, E_RAM (External RAM) support implemented
    Improved interupt handling, HALT, STOP, and panic / illegal state handling
    Basic logging infrastructure setup for debugging and state tracking


That being said. My goals are not set in stone. But at bare-min basic functionality would be nice.

### ðŸŽ® My priority so far:
 - [ ] Efficent, smart way of coding emulation (Will I ever truely check this?)
 - [ ] MBC Emulation, banking switching, Cartrige RAM (Partial Done)
 - [X] MMU address space handling. (Partially Done)
 - [X] CPU OP Code/ Instruction Emulation (Most Done)
 - [ ] All OPCodes & Prefixed CPU instructions finished
 - [ ] Test & Verify All CPU OPCodes ensuring no Desyncranization occures (On Going)
 - [ ] Debugger, logger, way to verify each Instruction, RAM etc
 - [ ] VRAM, GPU, LCD Emulation
 - [ ] Rendering of screen, logos, images, sprites.
 - [ ] PPU, APU emulation (Visual, LCD, Audio)
 - [ ] .. more I am sure

#### Hope to reach:
 - [ ] Full MBC Emulation. (All Versions) + MBC Ram Saves, Timers, Rumble Support
 - [ ] Handle Known GB Bugs
 - [ ] Handling of multiple colour palette
 - [ ] Cycle Accuracy, Correct Speed

#### Special "Would be nice", but so far away, closer to a dream.
 - [ ] Support for Link-Cable 
 - [ ] Visual debugger, inspector
 - [ ] Instruction viewer, UI based instruction monitor, save and record,
 - [ ] Headless mode. Pre-set instructions for game.
 - [ ] Hyper speed, be able to easily scale speed, for testing, or simulations
 - [ ] Able to run in parallel 
 - [ ] Bot controlled, or Machine learning/ simulation mode
